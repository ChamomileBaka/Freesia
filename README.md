## Cyandin !!
<i>-Break down ysm's locking of communicating protocols and open source community! </i></br>

## What is this?
As the locking down of ysm's protocol and the dis-responsible developers of ysm killed many thrid-party projects, It's getting more and more difficult to write a new plugin version and many developers quited developing them</br>
So to make a new plugin version, Cyanidin came out.And Cyanidin is a set of mods and plugins which aimed to run the functions of ysm on plugin servers.

## Some notices
This project is under control of BakaMC and all copyrights reversed to BakaMC

## Build
For some compatible issues, the Cyanidin-Worker module doesn't be included in the main module. So you need build them one by one</br>

Build the plugin modules:

Run this in your terminal:
``
./gradlew shadowJar
`` 
And you'll find the jars in <module>/build/libs</br>

Build the mod modules:

Run this in your terminal:
``
./gradlew build
``
And you'll find the jars in <module>/build/libs</br>
